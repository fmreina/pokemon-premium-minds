HELLO_WELCOME = Hello and welcome to the Pokemon World!

INSTRUCTIONS = Your task today is to walk around and catch as many pokemons as possible. \n\
                And to do it you need to inform a sequence of movements, indicating the direction you want to go. \n\
                You can choose to go N (north), S (south), E (east) or W (west). \n\
                Each movement will take you into a new position and there you will find a pokemon to catch. \n\
                If the movements take you into a position you have already visited there will be no pokemons to catch. \n\
                So choose wisely your steps not to fall into the same spot twice. \n\
                Now go explore the world, catch as many pokemons you can and become a new Pokemon Master!
